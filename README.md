# 1. What is CustomKing
CustomKing is a framework for machine learning, which is a framework similar to Detectron2 written by Fvcore. The differences between CustomKing and Detectron2 are as follows:

(1) CustomKing is used for classification or calibration tasks, while Detectron2 is used for detection or segmentation tasks.

(2) The code does not need to be compiled when installing CustomKing, while Detectron2 needs to be compiled. Therefore, CustomKing can easily be compatible with the Linux and Windows systems.
